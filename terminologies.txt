1. product backlog -> contains all the potential features and improvements for a product.

2. Sprint Backlog ->  a list of tasks, features, and work items that a development team 
                      commits to completing during a single sprint in Agile methodology.

3. sprint -> A Sprint is a short, time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) in Agile development 
             where a team works on completing a specific set of tasks or features.

4. User Stories -> Describes a feature or requirement from the user's perspective.
                  template:As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]
                  example: As a customer, I want to receive order confirmation emails so that I know my order was placed successfully

5. Tasks -> Breaks down a User Story into smaller, actionable steps.More technical and focused on implementation.
            Example (for the above user story):
                Create an email template for order confirmation.
                Implement backend logic for sending emails.
                Test email functionality before deployment.
            * Think of a User Story as the goal, while Tasks are the steps needed to achieve that goal
